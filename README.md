A **Swift** based Dependency Injection implementation. Wherever you **Need** a service, you can get it.

## Features
- Service Locator
- Services injection aware utility class.


## Installation
**The only way is to use CocoaPods.**

### CocoaPods

To install Need, include the following in your Podfile

```ruby
  pod 'Need', '~> 1.0'
```

## How To

### Setup

After adding the framework to your project, you need to import the module in your `AppDelegate`

```swift
import Need
```

Now, a `LazyServiceLocator` attribute to your `AppDelegate` :

```swift
  /// The main service locator
  let lazyServiceLocator: LazyServiceLocator = LazyServiceLocator()
```  

Add the following before the return statement of the `application(_ application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method:


```swift
  self.processRegistration()
```

To finish, implement the `ServicesRegistry' protocol as the following:

```swift
extension AppDelegate: ServicesRegistry {
  var serviceLocator: ServiceLocator {
    return self.lazyServiceLocator
  }

  func processRegistration() {
    // Add here your own services
    // self.lazyServiceLocator.addService(OwnServiceImplementation() as OwnServiceProtocol)
  }
}
```

### Usage

Utility classes `ServicesInjectionAware` and `ServicesInjectionAwareViewController` are available in *Need*. You can use it as the following:

```swift
class OwnViewController: ServicesInjectionAwareViewController {
  lazy var ownService: OwnServiceProtocol = {
    return getService()
  }()
  
  // Use your own service wherever you need.
}
```
